<p>This project was a part of DataScience4All Women's Summit 2022, sponsored by Correlation One. We analyzed the impact of different socio-economic factors on housing prices during the Covid-19 pandemic, and forecasted two years of average US housing prices (2022-2024) in reaction to the FED's housing market correction plan.  </p>
